## Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Marlon Nunez, a Software Engineer currently working as Project Manager

## Current Role

I am a skilled full-stack engineer specializing in JavaScript, Node.js, and React.js, currently serving as a Project Manager at NewGlobe, a global education leader. In my role, I excel in stakeholder engagement, strategic planning, and project management across various timelines, as well as demonstrating a comprehensive understanding of both frontend and backend development concepts.

Looking forward, I am looking to transition into the tech industry, focusing on roles as a Full Stack Developer or web developer. Excited to leverage my experience, I aim to contribute meaningfully to the dynamic technology landscape and enhance my proficiency in software development.

## Background 

In February 2023, I took a bold step towards my tech-focused journey, enrolling in a transformative 10-month [Full Stack Software Engineering online bootcamp](https://practicum.com/software-engineer/?form_position=%2F&gaid=940678093.1681249137). Kicking off with foundational front-end engineering principles such as HTML and CSS, my exploration extended into the realms of JavaScript, React.js, Node.js, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, and the development of RESTful APIs. This immersive experience also encompassed various essential concepts, frameworks, and libraries.

From an early age, my affinity for STEM disciplines has been a guiding force. In my undergraduate years, I pursued a major in Public Health and Neuroscience, culminating in the attainment of a Bachelor of Science in Public Health from Tulane University in 2018. Subsequently, in 2020, I earned a Masters in Education from Boston University and ventured into the field of teaching. Two years later, transitioning into roles as an operations director and project manager, I rediscovered my passion for technology and explored the exciting realm of software engineering. 

Looking ahead, my journey continues with the anticipation of a 9-month [Data Science bootcamp](https://practicum.com/data-science/?form_position=%2Fsoftware-engineer%2F&gaid=940678093.1681249137) through TripleTen, commencing in February 2024. My aim is to cultivate a profound understanding of both fields, positioning myself as a more-rounded and versatile engineer for prospective employers, their companies, and my own ongoing professional and personal development.
