## Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Marlon Nunez, a Software Engineer and Project Manager

## Current Role

I am Full-stack engineer specializing in JavaScript, Node, and React, with a proven track record in project management and stakeholder engagement. Leveraging my academic background in project management and STEM fields, my aim is to play a pivotal role in a mission-driven organization dedicated to delivering impactful business solutions across diverse sectors.

## Background 

In February 2023, I enrolled in TripleTen's 10-month Online Bootcamp for [Full Stack Software Engineering](https://tripleten.com/software-engineer/), where I gained extensive experience in full-stack engineering concepts and completed multiple full-stack projects. While focusing primarily on the MERN (Mongo, Express, React, and Node) stack, I also acquired proficiency in additional languages like Python and SQL, and explored various technologies such as GraphQL, KeystoneJS, among others during the program.

From 2014 to 2018, I pursued a Bachelor's of Science in Public Health (BSPH) with a double major in Neuroscience at Tulane University. Following my undergraduate studies, I embarked on my professional journey as an educator in 2018 while concurrently pursuing a master's degree at Boston University. In 2020, I proudly attained a Masters in Education from Boston University.


Looking ahead, my journey continues with the anticipation of a 9-month [Data Science bootcamp](https://practicum.com/data-science/?form_position=%2Fsoftware-engineer%2F&gaid=940678093.1681249137) through TripleTen, commencing in February 2024. My aim is to cultivate a profound understanding of both fields, positioning myself as a more-rounded and versatile engineer for prospective employers, their companies, and my own ongoing professional and personal development.
