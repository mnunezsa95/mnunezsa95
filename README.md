## Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Marlon Nunez, a Software Engineer currently working as Project Manager

## Current Role

I am a seasoned full-stack engineer with specialization in JavaScript, Node.js, and React.js, currently serving as a Project Manager at NewGlobe, a leading global education company dedicated to promoting educational sustainability on a worldwide scale. My professional expertise spans stakeholder engagement, strategic planning, and the proficient execution of projects, encompassing both short-term and long-term initiatives.

As I look ahead, my aspirations involve a transition into the tech industry, with a keen focus on pursuing roles as a Full Stack Software Engineer or web developer. I am excited about leveraging my extensive experience and skills to contribute meaningfully to the dynamic landscape of technology and further enhance my proficiency in software development.

## Background 

From an early age, I've been drawn to STEM disciplines. In my undergraduate years, I majored in Public Health and Neuroscience, earning a Bachelor of Science in Public Health from Tulane University in 2018. Subsequently, in 2020, I obtained a Masters in Education from Boston University and decided to go into teaching. Two years, after my teaching role, I worked as an operations director and project manager, where I was reacquainted with my passion for technology, and discovered the software engineering branch. While several years out of college, my passion for technology, data, and engineering emerged, leading me to delve into HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, and SQL during my free time.

In February 2023, I took a significant leap towards my tech-focused future by enrolling in a 10-month [Full Stack Software Engineering online bootcamp](https://practicum.com/software-engineer/?form_position=%2F&gaid=940678093.1681249137) at [TripleTen by Yandex (formerly known as Practicum).](https://practicum.com/) Commencing with front-end engineering principles like HTML and CSS, my journey progressed with a strong focus on JavaScript, React.js, Node.js, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, creating RESTful APIs, as well as many other essential concepts, frameworks and libraries. 

I am set to embark on the subsequent 9-month [Data Science bootcamp](https://practicum.com/data-science/?form_position=%2Fsoftware-engineer%2F&gaid=940678093.1681249137) through TripleTen. My objective is to cultivate a profound understanding of both fields, positioning myself as a more-rounded versatile engineer for prospective employers and their companies, as well as, my own professional and personal development.
