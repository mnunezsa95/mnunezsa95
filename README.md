## Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Marlon Nunez, an aspiring Software Engineer / Data Scientist

## Background 
I am currently working as Project Manager for NewGlobe, a small Edtech and Ed Management company geared towards providing educational sustainbility in countries around the world. Long term, I am hoping to break into the tech industry as a Data Scientist or Full Stack Software Engineer.

Growing up I always always STEM oriented. During my time in undergrad I majored in Public Health and Neuroscience and earned a Bachelor of Science in Public Health from Tulane University in 2018. In 2020, I graduated from Boston Unversity with a Masters in Education. However, I discovered my passion for technology, data, and engineering a few years out of college, when I started learning some Python, R, and SQL during my freetime. 

In February 2023, I decided to take a big step towards my future and enrolled in a 10 month [Full Stack Software Engineering online bootcamp](https://practicum.com/software-engineer/?form_position=%2F&gaid=940678093.1681249137) at [Practicum by Yandex.](https://practicum.com/) My learning journey started with a focus on principles of front-end engineering such as HTML and CSS, followed by a strong emphasis on JavaScript, React.js, Node.js, MongoDB, APIs, and other major concepts. I am scheduled to graduate from Practicum's Software Engineering Bootcamp in December 2023. After completing the program, I am scheduled to begin the 9 month [Data Science bootcamp](https://practicum.com/data-science/?form_position=%2Fsoftware-engineer%2F&gaid=940678093.1681249137) through Practicum. My goal is to have a strong understanding of both fields to become a versatile engineer to future employers.
